					<h2>History and Purpose</h2>
					<p>The Georgian Digital Text Collective, a website devoted to the literature and culture of the Republic of Georgia, was begun in 2007 to provide resources in Georgian and English for students, scholars, and members of the public interested in Georgian history and culture.  Early contributions to this site include literary texts from the 19th and 20th centuries, and are growing to include texts from earlier and contemporary periods, resources, and multi-media projects.  Works include those by major Georgian authors such as Vazha-Pshavela, Erlom Akhvlediani, and Lado Asatiani.</p>
					<p>Texts on this site are provided in htmlstrict format, and so are searchable and can be printed or copied for other uses, such as with text analysis software.  Further development of the website as a participatory digital collection will include media in open or commonly used data formats such as .WAV, .OGG/H.264, and .JPEG.  To be able to invite colleagues and other scholars to contribute work on a regular, though regulated, basis, the site will develop and provide mark-up standards and other digital parameters for submitting materials.</p>
