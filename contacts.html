					<h2>History and Purpose:</h2>
					<p>The Georgian Digital Text Collective, a website devoted to the literature and culture of the Republic of Georgia, was begun in 2007 to provide resources in Georgian and English for students, scholars and researchers of Georgian history and culture. Early contributions to this site included literary texts from the 19th and 20th centuries, but are growing to include literature from earlier and more contemporary periods. Works include those by major Georgian authors, such as Vazha-Pshavela, Erlom Akhvlediani, and Lado Asatiani. Audio recordings of both classical (before 1918) and contemporary authors, as well as other media types, including still images, film and drama are planned for the site.</p>
					<p>Texts on this site are provided in html format, which means they are searchable and can easily be printed or copied for other uses, such as with text analysis software. Further development of the website as a participatory digital collection will include media in open or commonly used data formats, such as .WAV, .OGG/H.264, and .JPEG. To be able to invite colleagues and other scholars to contribute work on a regular -- but regulated -- basis, the site will develop and provide mark-up standards and other digital parameters for submitting materials.</p>
